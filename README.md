# Covid-Levitt-matrix
Visulalizations for deaths due to covid pandamic.
1. Covid analysis based on Levitt matrix 
Levitt, who won the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, earlier predicted about the epidemic in China that it would get through the worst of its devastating outbreak before several other health experts predicted.
Let's check for India data

# Conclusion :
    * H(t) is 1.001 that means pandamic is over as per lavitt's matrix statement. 
    * Matrix Stated: H(t) will reach at 1.001 when x(Days) will be around 185 days but even after 280 days it did not reach there.
    * to reach H(t) at 1.001 approx 380 days will be required as per above graph. 
    * New value for H(t) will reach at 1.001 definately twice the given value(Levitt’s Metric).
    * Due several outlier's such as lockdown open and other's Levitt’s Metric results show's huge variations.
    * It was observed that H(t) falls linearly with x(Days) But doesnot follow tight linearity.
    * Evan r^2 show's huge variation as for livitt matrix it was around 0.0896 and in this observation it is around 0.94.
